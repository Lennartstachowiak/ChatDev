# Maze Generator and Solver User Manual

## Introduction

Welcome to the Maze Generator and Solver software! This software allows you to generate random mazes and solve them using a depth-first search algorithm. Whether you want to challenge yourself with a complex maze or simply enjoy the process of maze generation, this software is perfect for you.

## Main Functions

The Maze Generator and Solver software provides the following main functions:

1. Generate Maze: This function generates a random maze using a maze generation algorithm. Each time you click the "Generate Maze" button, a new maze will be created.

2. Solve Maze: This function solves the generated maze using a depth-first search algorithm. Clicking the "Solve Maze" button will find a solution path from the start position to the end position of the maze.

## Installation

To use the Maze Generator and Solver software, you need to install the required dependencies. Follow the steps below to install the necessary dependencies:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download and install Python from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you have saved the software files.

3. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This command will install the `tkinter` library, which is used for the graphical user interface of the software.

## Usage

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the Maze Generator and Solver software by following these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you have saved the software files.

2. Run the following command to start the software:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

   This command will launch the software's graphical user interface.

3. The software window will appear, showing an empty canvas and two buttons: "Generate Maze" and "Solve Maze".

4. Click the "Generate Maze" button to generate a random maze on the canvas. Each cell of the maze will be represented by a black rectangle.

5. Once the maze is generated, you can click the "Solve Maze" button to find a solution path from the start position to the end position of the maze. The solution path will be represented by green rectangles.

6. If a solution is found, the software will display the solved maze on the canvas. If no solution is found, a message will be printed in the terminal or command prompt.

7. You can repeat the process by clicking the "Generate Maze" button again to generate a new maze and solve it.
